# Parameterized-DNN

This code is used to do parameterized deep neural network for new particle search in the field of Particle Physics.
General info, please refer to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.07913.pdf

The codes are under developed.
### Structure:
* make_array.ipynb: convert tree into numpy array, and save those array to h5 formart
* work_all.ipynb: apply training, testing, and examination
* write2tree.ipynb: write the DNN output results back to trees for further studies

If you are runing the code in your local PC, please install Keras[https://keras.io/]
and its relevant tools firstly.

To use the notebooks, please install Jupyter.
If without Jupyter, you can extract each code in notebook into separate python scripts.
